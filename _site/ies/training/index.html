                <h2><a href='/modules/assessing_knowledge/'>How Different Types of Knowledge Are Assessed</a></h2>
                <p>Effectively assessing different types of knowledge requires asking students to complete different types of tasks.
                This interactive module helps you identify the types of tasks best used to assess declarative knowledge, procedural
                knowledge, and problem solving. It also describes the types of tasks associated with higher levels of cognitive
                complexity. Issues related to selecting tasks that align with standards are introduced, and guidelines for creating
                performance objectives are provided.

                <h2><a href='/files/summer_2011_complex_assessment.pptx'>Complex Assessment in Science Education</a></h2>
                <p>Complex assessments are used to estimate a learner's proficiency with competencies that cannot be evaluated
                using conventional written tests, such as those widely used in large-scale testing programs. Complex assessments
                can be uniquely used to measure competencies involving problem solving, such as creating a plan for carrying out
                a scientific investigation. They are essential for measuring complex procedural knowledge, such as formulating
                scientifically testable questions, or complex declarative knowledge, such as explaining relationships between
                biotic and abiotic factors in an ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Dr. Albert Oosterhof used the following PowerPoint slides during an assessment workshop for science teachers.
                Participants had previously completed the accompanying training module on
                <em>How Different Types of Knowledge Are Assessed</em>. During the workshop, teachers used this background to
                create assessment tasks relevant to their students and to practice using performance assessment specifications
                to produce and score complex assessments.

				<h2><a href='/files/FCR STEM Presentation - 12-7-12.pptx'>Formative Assessment of Cognitively Complex Science Competencies</a></h2>
				<p>The 2012 Florida Center for Research in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics conference was held in 
					St. Petersburg, Florida, in December. CALA’s session, “Formative Assessment of Cognitively Complex Science Competencies,” 
					focused on learning progressions, which are sequences of learning goals that help students achieve a complex target competency. 
					Learning progressions describe the subskills and enabling knowledge that students need to achieve the target competency. 
					Moreover, they suggest strategies for instruction and formative assessment of learning goals and the target competency 
					by elucidating desired outcomes of instruction. <a href='/files/FCR STEM Presentation - 12-7-12.pptx'>View the presentation&#8230;</a></p>

                	    <h2><a href='/modules/assessment_feedback/'>Using Feedback with Formative Assessments</a></h2>
			    <p>Feedback, in the context of a formative assessment, pertains to information conveyed with the intent of modifying a learner’s thinking or behavior with the purpose of improving learning. Our present focus is on feedback from the teacher to a student, although it can involve feedback from one student to another, or from a student to the teacher. This module uses the results of two fairly recent and important research reviews that describe emerging patterns of feedback that will help structure our discussion. <a href='/modules/assessment_feedback/'>Begin working with the module&#8230;</a></p>

                <h2><a href='/files/formative_feedback.pptx'>Formative Feedback</a></h2>
                <p>Shute (2008) defines formative feedback as information provided to learners in order to modify their thinking
                or behavior and thus improve learning. Effective feedback has been shown to support learning across diverse
                content areas, knowledge and skill types, and levels of education (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998). However, crafting
                and delivering good feedback is not as easy as it may seem, as illustrated by misconceptions and practices
                inconsistent with best practices that have been identified through research.</p>
                <p>The following PowerPoint presentation by Dr. Valerie Shute and Umit Tokac covers topics related to formative
                feedback, specifically in relation to types and timing of feedback and the interaction of these elements with
                students' abilities. <a href='/files/formative_feedback.pptx'>Begin working through this presentation&#8230;</a></p>
