                <p>Effectively assessing different types of knowledge requires asking students to complete different types of tasks. 
                This interactive module helps you identify the types of tasks best used to assess declarative knowledge, procedural 
                knowledge, and problem solving. It also describes the types of tasks associated with higher levels of cognitive 
                complexity. Issues related to selecting tasks that align with standards are introduced, and guidelines for creating 
                performance objectives are provided.

                <p>Complex assessments are used to estimate a learner's proficiency with competencies that cannot be evaluated 
                using conventional written tests, such as those widely used in large-scale testing programs. Complex assessments 
                can be uniquely used to measure competencies involving problem solving, such as creating a plan for carrying out 
                a scientific investigation. They are essential for measuring complex procedural knowledge, such as formulating 
                scientifically testable questions, or complex declarative knowledge, such as explaining relationships between 
                biotic and abiotic factors in an ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Dr. Albert Oosterhof used the following PowerPoint slides during an assessment workshop for science teachers. 
                Participants had previously completed the accompanying training module on 
                <em>How Different Types of Knowledge Are Assessed</em>. During the workshop, teachers used this background to 
                create assessment tasks relevant to their students and to practice using performance assessment specifications 
                to produce and score complex assessments.

                <h2><a href='/files/formative_feedback.pptx'>Formative Feedback</a></h2>
                <p>Shute (2008) defines formative feedback as information provided to learners in order to modify their thinking 
                or behavior and thus improve learning. Effective feedback has been shown to support learning across diverse 
                content areas, knowledge and skill types, and levels of education (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998). However, crafting 
                and delivering good feedback is not as easy as it may seem, as illustrated by misconceptions and practices 
                inconsistent with best practices that have been identified through research.</p>
                <p>The following PowerPoint presentation by Dr. Valerie Shute and Umit Tokac covers topics related to formative 
                feedback, specifically in relation to types and timing of feedback and the interaction of these elements with 
                students' abilities. <a href='/files/formative_feedback.pptx'>Begin working through this presentation&#8230;</a></p>
