        we strive to enhance our understanding of learning and of the most appropriate
        methods to assess learning at all levels of cognitive complexity. To achieve this goal, we
        created and completed a preliminary evaluation of the Capabilities-Complexity Model, a strategy
        that contributes to the production of rigorous instruction and assessment.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>Understanding of the nature of knowledge and how learning occurs has progressed significantly
        in the past 20 years, largely through advances in the field of cognitive psychology. Believing
        that existing models do not provide adequate guidance related to the development of assessments,
        the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) requested that we develop a model to evaluate items
        presently being used in Florida’s high-stakes tests. The challenge was to develop a workable model
        that applied research in cognitive psychology to the field of assessment.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>Albert Oosterhof, professor emeritus at <abbr title="Florida State University">FSU</abbr>'s
        Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems and author of several prominent
        assessment books, headed the <acronym title="Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment">
        CALA</acronym> research team. Over a two-year period, we developed the Capabilities-Complexity Model,
        which addressed the types of cognitive capabilities and defined levels of complexity for each capability.
        Unlike other approaches used to establish assessment complexity, the Capabilities-Complexity Model incorporates
        important distinctions recognized by psychologists with respect to how one assesses declarative
        knowledge, procedural knowledge, and problem solving. We created training modules to field test
        the model with two groups of educators&mdash;marketing teachers for teacher certification and science
        teachers for the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test. More recently,
        <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr> asked <acronym title="Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment">
        CALA</acronym> to examine the feasibility of applying the model to Florida’s recently revised
        achievement standards in Mathematics and Reading/Language Arts.</p>

        <h2>The Results</h2>

        <p>In using the model, educators not only were able to reach consensus on the types of capabilities
        test items measured and their levels of complexity, but they also saw the model’s potential for
        guiding classroom teaching. Compared to approaches for determining cognitive complexity presently
        used by the National Assessment of Educational Progress and by many states including Florida,
        this model also appears to simplify the process of evaluating complexity because separate and
        more focused rubrics are used to establish the cognitive complexity of skills associated with
        the respective types of capabilities. Using the model for instruction and assessment is expected
        to improve the test alignment process. And, because the model focuses on developing activities
        geared toward higher cognitive demands, it meaningfully raises the bar on learning
        expectations.</p>

        <p>At the request of <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr>,
        <acronym title="Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment">CALA</acronym>
        submitted a symposium proposal to the Council of Chief State School Officers and was invited
        to present its research at the 2008 National Conference of Student Assessment. In addition,
        <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr> has asked
        <acronym title="Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment">CALA</acronym>
        to expand training and research to other academic areas and to train assessment
        and curriculum divisions of <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr>
        in the model.</p>
