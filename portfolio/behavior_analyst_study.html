        <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e collaborated with the Florida Department of Children and Families and the
        Behavior Analyst Certification Board to develop and administer Floridaâ€™s behavior
        analyst and associate behavior analyst certification examinations. We transferred
        existing test items into a computerized test bank; trained content experts; reviewed,
        revised, and developed test items; developed test forms; administered, scored, and
        conducted cut-score studies; and disseminated score reports. The success and quality
        of these certification examinations led to national and international recognition and
        subsequent administrations.</p>
