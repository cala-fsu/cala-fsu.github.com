        we want to be a part of bringing top-quality teachers into the classroom. We
        developed valid and reliable test items for teacher certification examinations with
        the goal that the examinations truly measure what is expected of a beginning teacher.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p><acronym title="Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment">CALA</acronym>
        was commissioned by the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) to develop
        test items for seven Florida Teacher Certification Examinations (FTCE), from initial
        test developer training to revision of the test information guide, with numerous steps
        in between.</p>

        <p>A more abstract undertaking was to increase the cognitive demand of individual test
        items&mdash;to create questions that test examineesâ€™ capabilities at different levels.
        Each item must test a particular skill that reflects knowledge of a subject area.
        Items had to be accurate, unbiased, and current, while containing information that
        would remain relevant over a five-year period.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>To complete this complex project, we turned to our diverse talents in training,
        test development, writing, editing, graphic and web design, marketing, and software
        engineering.</p>

        <p>Our measurement specialists assembled committees of subject-matter experts from
        across the state and trained them to revise, develop, and validate test items.
        Working with these experts, we revised and developed documents such as item specifications,
        competencies and skills, and test blueprints. At any time, <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">
        FLDOE</abbr> could participate in test development meetings from a
        remote location using web meeting software.</p>

        <p>We used test bank software for the bank of items. Measurement editors reviewed all test
        items and related documents for accuracy and adherence to measurement standards.</p>

        <img id="caseStudyPilotImage" src="/images/photo_cs_ftcedev2.png" alt="" />
        <p>Because new and revised test items must be pilot tested at centers that represent all
        regions of Florida, we coordinated with college and university testing centers to
        participate in Internet-based pilot testing. We developed marketing materials for the
        centers to publicize the testing opportunities to students. To prepare for the testing,
        we built a secure website and developed an online version of each examination, making
        sure that the test published properly and the data were captured. We created an instruction
        manual to train testing center proctors and provided onsite training to ensure that all
        procedures and computer requirements were met for test bank security and data capture.</p>

        <p>We redesigned test information guides to make them more user-friendly, guaranteeing
        that the sample test items in each guide reflected the examination in types and difficulty.
        We also developed online accessible versions to be incorporated into the
        <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr> website.</p>

        <h2>The Results</h2>

        <p>We succeeded in meeting the creative, technical, and logistical demands of the project.
        For the pilot testing, we created a secure platform for publishing the tests online and
        developed an application for locking down the computers at testing centers across the state.</p>

        <p>The test items we developed have been incorporated into the <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr>
        test banks and are now a part of the <abbr title="Florida Teacher Certification Examinations">FTCE</abbr>
        testing cycle. Current examinations will benefit from this infusion of new, rigorous, and relevant items.</p>
