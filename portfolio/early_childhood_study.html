        <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>ntervening early in the lives of at-risk children is critical in helping prepare
        them for school. As third-party evaluators, we examined the effectiveness of early
        childhood programs that addressed the needs of at-risk children and their families
        in Florida.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>In response to a legislative mandate, we evaluated nine statewide early childhood
        programs that provided services to children at critical stages, from conception to
        kindergarten. We had to gather data to determine if the programs were working and
        if their funding support was adequate and warranted.</p>

        <p>The programs included prekindergarten, prekindergarten for children with disabilities,
        Florida First Start, Teenage Parent Program, and Children’s Early Intervention Program.
        They were administered by the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) and the Florida
        Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (FLHRS).</p>

        <p>In addition to the evaluations, the law required longitudinal studies of the
        Prekindergarten Early Intervention Program and a research study of the continued
        educational involvement of parents whose children were formerly enrolled in the program.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>Over a five-year period, we traveled across Florida for field research and site visits
        to examine how the programs worked. To determine the effectiveness of each program, we
        conducted a statewide survey of all instructors, teachers, counselors, administrators,
        and program recipients. We also completed extensive program observation and face-to-face
        interviews with these groups at multiple sites within each region of the state.</p>

        <p>To chart the growth and efficacy of the Prekindergarten Early Intervention Program,
        we conducted 5- and 10-year longitudinal studies that involved collecting data such
        as student test scores and promotional rates. Our reports assessed the children’s behavior,
        growth and development, and achievement.</p>

        <p>For the research on the impact of parental involvement on early childhood education,
        we compared randomly selected students who had been involved with the program with those
        who had not. In comparing the students, we examined eight variables, such as achievement
        scores and attendance. In addition, we conducted surveys of parents and teachers involved
        in the program.</p>

        <p>Interim reports were provided to the <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">
        FLDOE</abbr>, <abbr title="Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services">
        FLHRS</abbr>, and state coordinating council that detailed the merits of each program.
        We presented comprehensive and summary reports to the legislature and testified regarding the
        programs.</p>

        <h2>The Results</h2>

        <p>Our research and reports provided the <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE
        </abbr>, <abbr title="Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services">FLHRS</abbr>,
        and legislature the required data to make informed policy decisions and improve program effectiveness.
        The agencies used our evaluations as the basis for requesting continuation of program funds, additional funds
        for program improvement, and expansion of programs to provide services to a larger population.
        Two of our reports won American Educational Research Association awards.</p>
