        <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e conducted a study for the Florida Department of Education that examined the
        effects of handwritten versus computer-written modes of communication on the quality of
        postsecondary studentsâ€™ essays. The results provided evidence for using the computer-based
        writing assessment for the essay portion of the Florida Teacher Certification Examinations,
        which would allow for cost-saving measures, as well as speed in score reporting.</p>
