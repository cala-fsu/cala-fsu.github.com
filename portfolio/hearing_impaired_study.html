        <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or the Florida Telecommunications Relay, Inc. (FTRI), we developed a
        marketing campaign to inform individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing,
        or speech impaired about the assistive equipment and services available
        to them at no charge. We arranged photo shoots with the target audiences,
        created brochures in two languages, and developed advertisements for newspapers
        and magazines. We also developed and produced the award-winning
        <abbr title="Florida Telecommunications Relay, Inc.">FTRI</abbr> newsletter
        <em>The Florida Link</em>. We oversaw all publications production from start to finish.</p>

        <p>For the “Don’t Hang Up, Do Business” campaign, we developed a multilingual
        instructional guide to help train business employees on how to communicate via a
        telephone relay service with customers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech impaired.
        In doing so, we helped raise awareness of the barriers that hearing-impaired individuals
        face and provided solutions for working with them.</p>
