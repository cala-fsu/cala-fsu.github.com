        <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>s part of a nationwide naturalization initiative to encourage citizenship, we delivered

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>Our task was to develop and conduct a statewide multimedia campaign for the Florida Department of
        Children and Families to encourage eligible individuals to become United States citizens. The key challenge
        was to create multilingual materials that would guide immigrants step-by-step through the naturalization process.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <blockquote><p><em>Other states adapted our multimedia materials for use in their naturalization
        offices.</em></p></blockquote>

        <p>We assessed needs, developed a multimedia marketing campaign, and designed instructional materials.
        These materials included a guidebook to the naturalization process, public service announcements, posters, and
        postcards. The Spanish, Haitian-Creole, and Serbo-Croatian materials were field tested with the target audiences
        to ensure the appropriateness of the content and accuracy of translation. Once all of the materials were completed,
        we provided training to personnel in Floridaâ€™s naturalization offices.</p>

        <h2>The Results</h2>

        <p>Our effective and user-friendly training materials helped aspiring citizens with the application process
        and preparation for the citizenship test and Immigration and Naturalization Service interview. In guiding the
        individuals toward naturalization, we helped them secure the rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizens. Other
        states adapted our multimedia materials for use in their naturalization offices. The project was extended to
        develop orientation training for refugees.</p>
