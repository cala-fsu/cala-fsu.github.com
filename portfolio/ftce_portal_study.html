        we use advanced technologies to provide broad access to information.
        For individuals interested in teaching in Florida, we developed a single, integrated
        online site that provides wide-ranging resources related to teacher certification.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>The Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) commissioned
        <acronym title="Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment">CALA</acronym>
        to develop a Web portal for the Florida Teacher Certification Examinations (FTCE).
        The portal had to be appropriate for a variety of audiences, including teacher candidates,
        teachers expanding certification, and career changers, and had to meet rigorous usability
        and accessibility standards. <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr>
        required that the design be consistent with its new Web site that was being implemented at
        the time. Our desire was to engage users and provide critical information in an easily
        navigable manner. To accomplish this task,
        <acronym title="Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment">CALA</acronym>
        staff had to organize diverse and comprehensive sets of information in a logical, meaningful
        way for the intended audience.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>In gathering current and relevant resources for the portal, we relied on the expertise
        of educators in colleges, universities, and Educator Preparation Institutes (EPI) across
        the state. We contacted deans, associate deans, department heads, and
        <abbr title="Educator Preparation Institutes ">EPI</abbr> directors,
        requesting their help in obtaining a list of resources from faculty members and subject-matter
        experts that were used in their teacher preparatory programs. To facilitate the response process,
        we created a password-protected, database-driven Web site where these resources could be uploaded.
        We verified all links and edited descriptions for quality and consistency.</p>

        <p>We wrote descriptions highlighting the requirements for each of the 44
        <abbr title="Florida Teacher Certification Examinations">FTCE</abbr> tests and
        offered downloadable competencies and skills for each examination. Additional information
        included certification requirements, types and lists of educator preparation programs,
        testing requirements, test information guides, and registration for certification
        examinations.</p>

        <p>We built the portal using Web standards-compliant
        <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> and
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The server-side code
        was written in C# on the ASP.NET platform, and an SQL Server database was used for storage.
        We tested the portal’s usability and accessibility to ensure that it reaches the largest
        possible audience.</p>

        <p>During the course of the project, we worked closely with
        <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr> assessment, Web development,
        and Blind Services groups to guarantee all elements of the portal met
        <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr> specifications. We conducted
        focus groups with the target audiences and incorporated their feedback
        into the final product.</p>

        <h2>The Results</h2>

        <p>The portal, which resides on the <a href="https://app1.fldoe.org/ftce/Portal/">FLDOE Web site</a>
        successfully integrates diverse information into a single comprehensive source. It gives individuals
        seeking teacher certification the tools they need to prepare for tests in their content area.
        From a design perspective, it integrates nicely into the
        <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr> Web site. The portal will be used
        as a model for accessible Web development for future
        <abbr title="Florida Department of Education">FLDOE</abbr> projects.</p>
