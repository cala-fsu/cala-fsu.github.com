        <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>s part of research and development for the Florida Department of Education,
        we created interactive electronic versions of four test information guides for the
        Florida Teacher Certification Examinations. We addressed the needs of individual
        learners who would access the guides and provided multisensory learning experiences
        for the various learning modalities and accessible versions with similar experiences
        for those with disabilities. The guides were field-tested by content experts, teachers,
        and persons with disabilities and commended for easy accessibility and attention to
        detail for diverse learners. The templates that were produced could be applied to
        other subject-area test information guides with minimum cost and effort.</p>
