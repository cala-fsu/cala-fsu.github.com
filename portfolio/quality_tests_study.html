        <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n today’s era of accountability, students’ standardized test scores are used
        to determine student retention, possible school sanctions, and federal funding.
        For years, <acronym title="Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment">CALA</acronym>
        has worked with the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) to
        provide quality control to ensure scoring accuracy for the Florida Comprehensive
        Assessment Test.</p>

        <p>Our software engineers maintain complex programs to replicate and verify the
        accuracy of scoring and of the student, school, district, and statewide reports
        provided by testing vendors each year. We also replicate the calculation of school
        grades for statewide mandates and Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) to meet the mandates
        of No Child Left Behind.</p>
