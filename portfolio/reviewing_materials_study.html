        <p><span class="dropcap">E</span>very five years, school districts across Florida must undergo a textbook
        adoption process, where materials undergo a comprehensive review. A team is formed
        to review materials and determine which books should be added to the state adoption list.
        We used research and input from citizens and publishers to assist the Florida Department
        of Education Bureau of Curriculum and Instruction to revise the stateâ€™s textbook adoption
        system and train committee participants. We developed sound criteria for assessing these
        instructional materials.</p>
