Tallahassee, Fla. -- The Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment (CALA) announces the release of its newly developed iPhone app, <a href="http://learn.cala.fsu.edu/">CALA Learn</a>. The app is a platform for providing educational learning activities that serve the community. Both the app and the module are available for free download at the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cala-learn/id719089434?mt=8&amp;uo=4" target="itunes_store">App Store</a>.  

The Florida Teacher Certification Examinations (FTCE) Reading module, the first in a series of learning activities, is designed by CALA test development experts to give users experience with the types and difficulty of items that appear on the FTCE General Knowledge Reading subtest. The module provides practice on the knowledge of key ideas and details, craft and structure, and integration of information and ideas based on text selections. The test questions are aligned with the Florida Department of Education competencies and skills to help users analyze their performance.
