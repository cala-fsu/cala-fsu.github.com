---
Tallahassee, Fla. â€“ Providing strategies for raising the level of academic demand on students was the focus of two training sessions presented by the Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment (CALA).

The purpose of the sessions was to demonstrate how to effectively integrate assessment with classroom instruction and learning, with the intention of tapping into more complex modes of thinking such as problem solving. Dr. Albert Oosterhof, professor emeritus at Florida State University, led the sessions. He provided an overview of the <a href="http://www.cala.fsu.edu/files/ccm.pdf">Capabilities-Complexity Model</a> and showed participants how to use the model to develop learning activities and assessments. The sessions included open discussions and hands-on application of the model to mathematics and reading/language arts.

"Our goal in putting together information for students is to help them learn and think at a variety of levels," according to keynote speaker Dr. Cornelia Orr, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. Orr stressed the importance of guiding students to go beyond traditional ways of thinking.

Professionals from diverse educational backgrounds attended the sessions, including Florida Department of Education employees and statewide curriculum specialists.
