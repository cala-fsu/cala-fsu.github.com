Tallahassee, Fla. – The Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment (CALA) launched on July 1, 2008. Formerly a part of the Center for Information, Training, and Evaluation Services, CALA is based at Florida State University’s research and development complex.

As a pioneer in the design of multimedia instructional materials and customized assessments, CALA assists policy makers and educators by providing them analyses and practical solutions.

"We take a holistic approach to instruction, learning and assessment," said Dr. Faranak Rohani, the director of CALA. "Our goal is to help our clients consider the entire cycle of learning without sacrificing any one element. To that end, we collaborate with them to set goals and develop research-based training and assessment tools."

CALA’s roots reach back to 1972, when it began as the Career Education Curriculum Laboratory, created to assist the Division of Vocational Education with establishing career education in Florida. Throughout the years, the center has provided products and services for assessment, evaluation, training and multimedia development to government, nonprofit and private-sector agencies.
